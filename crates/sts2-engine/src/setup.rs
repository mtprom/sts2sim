//! A fight said in the game's own terms: the loadout a player carries through
//! the door, and which door.
//!
//! A [`CombatSetup`] is the small, versioned document any producer can write
//! — a live run projecting the fight it stands in, a fold over a recorded
//! run's per-floor stats, a hand-written file — and the engine stands it up
//! through its own combat start, so nothing a fight's opening does is
//! skipped. It deliberately carries no RNG state, no opening hand, no enemy
//! health rolls, no map and no grab bags: all of those are the engine's to
//! generate, which is what lets one loadout serve many hands and lets a bank
//! of setups outlive every internal the engine cares to change.
//!
//! The complement is [`ScenarioBuilder`](crate::ScenarioBuilder), which says
//! everything and derives nothing — the right tool for a rule test that
//! needs turn three of a specific fight, and the wrong one for a bank.
