//! The command layer: the primitive vocabulary every content model is written
//! in.
//!
//! The pinned build composes cards, powers, relics, potions, events, and
//! monster moves out of a finite set of primitive effects. This module is
//! that surface, one enum per command family, one variant per gameplay
//! effect.
//! Anything an effect does that is only presentation — animation triggers,
//! VFX/SFX, camera shake, card previews, the timed waits that pace a beat —
//! has no variant, because none of it is observable through this simulator's
//! boundary.
//!
//! What each family leaves out, and why:
//!
//! - `CreatureCmd`: triggering an animation is presentation. Setting a
//!   creature's maximum HP outright is not reached by covered content.
//! - `CardCmd`: `AutoPlay` needs the play machinery for a card nobody chose;
//!   `Enchant`, `ClearEnchantment`, `Afflict`, `ClearAffliction`,
//!   `ApplyKeyword`, taking a keyword back off, and granting Sly for a single
//!   turn need the enchantment, affliction, and keyword subsystems, which do
//!   not exist; `Discard` on its own is unreached; previewing a card, and
//!   previewing a card joining a pile, are presentation. `Downgrade` is here,
//!   and so is the bulk form [`PowerCmd::DowngradeOwnersCards`] a Dampen
//!   writes, which has to note what it took before it takes it.
//! - `CardPileCmd`: putting a card into a pile as part of the player playing
//!   it is what playing a card does and belongs to the engine's own play path
//!   rather than to content. `ShuffleIfNecessary` runs inside `Draw` rather
//!   than being issued.
//! - `PlayerCmd`: setting energy or gold outright are compositions of the gain
//!   and lose pairs,
//!   `EndTurn` is a player decision rather than an effect, and completing a
//!   quest needs quest cards. `AddPet` is here; taking a pet away is not
//!   reached, because nothing in the pinned build takes a pet away — a pet
//!   that dies stays in the fight and the fight ending drops it.
//! - `PowerCmd`: finding an instance already standing to stack onto, and
//!   `ModifyAmount`, are the two halves of `Apply` — the search, and the
//!   stacking itself — rather than effects a model issues. Plating reaches
//!   `ModifyAmount` directly only on its multiplayer path.
//! - `RelicCmd`: the whole family is here.
//! - `PotionCmd`: drinking a potion is the potion model's own effect, not a
//!   command.
//! - `RewardsCmd`: the room-end reward screen is one the engine drives when a
//!   room finishes rather than content issuing it; generating that screen's
//!   rewards, or a custom set of them, is unreached.
//!
//! - `CardSelectCmd`: the whole screen surface is here. The automated-selector
//!   stack — pushing a selector, using one, resetting it, and suspending it —
//!   is how a selection screen is answered with nobody choosing, which is what
//!   the build's own automatic play leans on, and this simulator's decision
//!   boundary is that mechanism; deciding whether the local player is the one
//!   to pick, reporting a softlock, and logging a choice are multiplayer
//!   routing, telemetry, and logging. Four screens are shaped and fail as
//!   unsupported content because each needs a subsystem that does not exist:
//!   card creation results, transformation pools, enchantments, and bundles.
//!
//! - `OstyCmd`: the whole family is here, which is one effect.
//!
//! - `ForgeCmd`: `Forge` is the whole of the family's gameplay. Raising a
//!   Sovereign Blade's damage, and finding the blades to raise, are its own
//!   two halves rather than effects a model issues, and previewing a blade and
//!   the forge's combat-room flourish are presentation.
//!
//! - `OrbCmd`: eight effects, six variants. Channelling an orb named by its
//!   model and channelling one named by its kind are one and the same — an orb
//!   is named by its model either way — and `Evoke` is the shared body behind
//!   `EvokeNext` and `EvokeLast` rather than anything a model issues.
