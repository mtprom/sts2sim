//! The Regent's pool, pinned one behaviour at a time.
//!
//! The recording walks about a quarter of it; a scenario is the whole of the
//! evidence for everything else, and the scenarios are here whether or not the
//! recording also witnesses the card, because a recorded segment pins one path
//! through a body and a scenario pins the body.
//!
//! Three shapes recur and are worth naming once. A star cost is the second half
//! of what a card costs, and a card that costs more stars than its owner is
//! standing on is not a legal play at all. A forge stands a Sovereign Blade up
//! where its owner holds none outside the exhaust pile and sharpens every blade
//! they hold. And the blade itself is a token: it swings for what the forge has
//! grown it to, at the whole enemy side while its owner carries a seeking edge,
//! and works up as much block behind the blow as they have parry.
//!
//! Where a family of cards is one shape with different numbers — a power laid
//! down, a blow and nothing else — the family is one table-driven test and each
//! card of it is a row.
