//! Doom is a countdown written onto somebody else's life, and most of her pool
//! is one way or another of putting more of it there. A Soul is a token her own
//! cards conjure. And her pet is summoned rather than assumed: an Osty attack
//! is guarded on the pet standing, so a play made with no pet issues nothing at
//! all, which is a behaviour of its own and has its own test here.
//!
//! Where a family of cards is one shape with different numbers — a power laid
//! down, a body the baseline stops on — the family is one table-driven test
//! and each card of it is a row.
