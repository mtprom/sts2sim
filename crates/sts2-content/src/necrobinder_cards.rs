//! The Necrobinder's whole card pool, transcribed.
//!
//! Eighty-eight models: the four she starts with, the eighty a rolled rarity
//! can offer, the two ancients, and the two multiplayer-only cards no
//! single-player pool ever holds. Each is the run of commands the card issues
//! when it is played, in order, at both the levels it supports.
//!
//! Three things recur across the pool and are worth naming once. A summon
//! stands the pet up, raises its maximum, or brings it back, all through the
//! one step. An Osty attack is a blow dealt by the pet rather than by its
//! owner, and every one of them is guarded on the pet standing — the shake a
//! missing pet plays is presentation, and a play with no pet does nothing at
//! all. And a Soul is a token
//! card her own cards conjure by the handful, always into a rolled place in the
//! draw pile unless the body says otherwise.
