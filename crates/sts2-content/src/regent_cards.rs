//! The Regent's whole card pool, transcribed.
//!
//! Eighty-eight models: the four he starts with, the eighty a rolled rarity can
//! offer, the two ancients, and the two multiplayer-only cards no
//! single-player pool ever holds. Each is the run of commands the card issues
//! when it is played, in order, at both the levels it supports.
//!
//! Two things recur across the pool and are worth naming once. A star cost is
//! the second half of what a card costs — a card that declares no star cost has
//! none at all rather than a cost of zero — and a card that costs stars is
//! refused for stars the way any other is refused for energy. And a forge
//! stands a Sovereign Blade up where its owner holds none outside the exhaust
//! pile, and sharpens every blade they hold by the amount.
