//! The Silent's whole card pool, transcribed.
//!
//! Eighty-eight models: the four she starts with, the eighty a rolled rarity
//! can offer, the two ancients, and the two multiplayer-only cards no
//! single-player pool ever holds. Each is the run of commands the card issues
//! when it is played, in order, at both the levels it supports.
//!
//! Three things recur across the pool and are worth naming once. A Shiv is a
//! token card the Silent's own cards conjure by the handful, and conjuring them
//! is one add to the hand whether one was asked for or four. Poison is a debuff
//! that costs its holder what it is worth as their turn opens and wears off as
//! it bites. And Sly is a keyword that belongs to the discard itself: a Sly
//! card put into the discard pile plays itself for free once the batch it went
//! down in is finished.
