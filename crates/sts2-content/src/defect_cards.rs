//! The Defect's whole card pool, transcribed.
//!
//! Eighty-eight models: the four he starts with, the eighty a rolled rarity can
//! offer, the two ancients, and the two multiplayer-only cards no
//! single-player pool ever holds. Each is the run of commands the card issues
//! when it is played, in order, at both the levels it supports.
//!
//! Three things recur across the pool and are worth naming once. Channelling
//! evokes the front of a full queue to make room before the new orb joins the
//! back of it. Evoking takes the next orb, and every card but three takes that
//! orb out of the queue; the three that do not evoke the same orb twice and
//! take it out on the last of them. And a card that reads how many orbs its
//! owner is holding reads either the plain count or the number of distinct
//! kinds, and the two are different questions.
